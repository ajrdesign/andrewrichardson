The once impressive carousel has taken [quite](http://www.creativebloq.com/accessibility-expert-warns-stop-using-carousels-7133778) a beating from the UX comity lately. This has come at little surprise to myself as the degree they have spread to homepage designs is astounding. As visibility of the carousel grows the demand from our clients to have one on the homepage also grows. How can we balance this desire from our clients (you know the ones that pay the bills) while satisfying the people who use our websites with a good experience?

There's been a lot of talk about this around the web and the consensus seems to be that using carousels is bad... **ever**. I'll admit this was my first impression after reading some of these articles but after I let it sink in I realized that that kind of dogmatic thinking is exactly what got us to use carousels in the first place. Carousels were a knee jerk reaction to the "place all the important content above the fold" ideal, which has been fading recently. In order to keep all the "important" content above the fold we just hid it away behind multiple slides that they can simply click through. Huzzah! We've made the shareholders happy!

But then we had more issues: People weren't understanding that they could click through the content. The small dots below or arrows didn't make clear what the UI elements did or that there was actually more content to be found. So what did we do? Make it auto-forward! Then we sat back, fat and content with the job we've done, until [usability tests revealed that we've done a poor job of appeasing the real people who use our webpages](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/auto-forwarding/).

All this stemmed from the fact that we HAD to cram all that information into the "above the fold" area. The people using our websites couldn't possibly be bothered to scroll or navigate to the content they cared about so we had to make an "easier" way of doing it.

This dogmatic approach to the "fold" caused this so I fear approaching the carousel with a solid "never" is a poor solution.

Lets rethink the carousel and the problems it's solving (and causing). First lets dive into the problem it's trying to solve.

## The homepage fold

If you've done a reasonable amount of web work you've probably had a conversation or two (Or many more) about the fold. Many would lead you to believe that no one reads/scrolls [past the "fold"](http://iampaddy.com/lifebelow600/). [Research shows](http://blog.clicktale.com/2006/12/23/unfolding-the-fold/) that this isn't really true. 76% of visitors scrolled to some extent(Meaning they actually consumed more than just the fold content) and nearly 22% of your visitors will scroll **all the way to the bottom** of your page, no matter how long it is.

Convincing shareholders/clients that the fold isn't a hard and fast rule can go a long way to opening the discussion to other ways of handling the content besides a carousel. You can start talking about how you are going to lead the visitors through the page, how copy and images must complement each other and answer the questions in their head at that particular moment.
